# Validation

`map_maker` uses validity gates before subjective or statistical quality
assessment. The current harness is an integration baseline for the executable
prototype. Its thresholds are provisional safety envelopes, not calibrated
Earth-realism criteria.

## Running The Gallery

```bash
uv run map-maker validate --config configs/validation.yaml
```

The command generates the fixed seeds in the validation configuration and
writes:

- `out/validation/report.json`: metrics, thresholds, checksums, and gate results.
- `out/validation/gallery.png`: labeled side-by-side physical previews.
- `out/validation/runs/`: persisted datasets and manifests for every seed.

The command exits nonzero when an automated gate fails. A passing exit code
still requires human review of `gallery.png`.

## Global Gates

`cold_determinism`
: Regenerates the first seed with an independent empty cache. Every persisted
  artifact checksum and the final preview checksum must match.

`unique_seed_outputs`
: Every configured seed must produce a distinct preview checksum. This catches
  seed omissions in cache keys and RNG plumbing.

`cache_replay`
: An immediate replay of every seed must restore every stage from cache while
  preserving every artifact checksum and the preview checksum. Artifact content
  is verified while hydrating cache entries; corrupt entries are invalidated and
  recomputed rather than returned as hits.

## Per-World Gates

`finite_fields`
: Every persisted numeric array must contain only finite values.

`land_fraction`
: Land fraction must remain inside the configured prototype envelope.

`land_components`
: Counts wrap-connected land components above a resolution-relative minimum
  size. This rejects single-feature failures without treating pixel noise as
  islands.

`largest_landmass_fraction`
: Limits the fraction of all land owned by the largest connected component.
  The current permissive ceiling allows supercontinents because assembly state
  is not yet represented causally.

`mixed_plate_fraction`
: Measures the fraction of mechanical plates carrying both continental and
  oceanic crust. This catches regression to the rejected one-plate/one-crust
  model.

`longitude_seam_ratio`
: Compares the mean elevation jump across the longitude seam with ordinary
  adjacent-cell elevation differences.

`plate_boundary_relief_ratio`
: Compares mean terrain gradient on mechanical plate boundaries with background
  terrain gradient. It catches elevation that directly redraws the plate mosaic.

## Human Review

Review the fixed gallery for failures not represented by current metrics:

- Repeated continent silhouettes or obvious generator motifs.
- Straight or uniformly narrow mountain streaks.
- Polygonal plate-cell impressions.
- Projection or wrap seams.
- Implausible coast stair-stepping, radial islands, or bathymetric rays.
- Seeds that are numerically distinct but visually near-identical.

Human review is recorded outside the report for now. A later review artifact
should record reviewer, software version, decision, and notes without allowing a
subjective pass to override failed automated gates.

## Calibration Rule

Do not tighten or loosen a threshold solely to make the current gallery pass.
Changes require at least one of:

- A synthetic failed case demonstrating metric sensitivity.
- A deterministic geological benchmark scenario.
- A distribution derived from an accepted reference dataset.
- A documented expansion of allowed world-history states.

No composite realism score is reported yet. The prototype lacks enough causal
subsystems and calibrated dimensions for such a number to be meaningful.
